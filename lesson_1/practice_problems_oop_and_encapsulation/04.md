In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?

* Encapsulation is not only packaging properties and operations in a single object. In some other programming languages, it is also the mechanism to hide the details of an object from the code that uses it. An object should only expose its properties and operations that other objects need to use the encapsulated object. 

In JavaScript, however, there is no direct mechanism to restrict the access to the properties and methods of an object. They are some ways though they are not perfect.
